Q1. Main Differences Between CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout Models
Dimensionality:

Flexbox: Designed for one-dimensional layouts (either rows or columns).

Grid: Designed for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns simultaneously).

Use Cases:

Flexbox: Ideal for aligning items within a single row or column, such as navigation bars, centering content, or distributing space within a container.

Grid: Best for complex layouts that require control over both rows and columns, such as entire page layouts or grid-based designs.

Control:

Flexbox: Provides control over the alignment, spacing, and distribution of items along a single axis.

Grid: Offers precise control over the placement and sizing of items in both rows and columns.

Complexity:

Flexbox: Simpler to use for straightforward, linear layouts.

Grid: More powerful for intricate, multi-dimensional layouts.

When to Choose One Over the Other:

Use Flexbox when you need to align items in a single direction (row or column) and want to distribute space within a container.

Use Grid when you need to create complex layouts with both rows and columns, and require precise control over the placement and sizing of items.

Q2. Role of Key Properties in Flexbox Layout Mode
justify-content:

Controls the alignment of items along the main axis (horizontal axis by default).

Common values: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly.

align-items:

Controls the alignment of items along the cross axis (vertical axis by default).

Common values: flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch.

gap:

Sets the spacing between items in the flex container.

Can be specified as a single value (e.g., 10px) for both row and column gaps, or separately (e.g., 10px 20px).

flex-direction:

Defines the direction of the main axis.

Common values: row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse.

flex-wrap:

Controls whether the flex items should wrap onto multiple lines or stay on a single line.

Common values: nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse.
